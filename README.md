## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"Offer an example of how to setup an expo app to receive notifications"._

## Some Observations about this App

- This app uses Typescript, so, if you never used it before with Expo, React-Native or React, this project could be a very good kickstart for you (I'm still learning, ok?  ðŸ˜‰).

- This project uses the React hooks all around (useCallback, useState, useEffect...), so, if you want to see these features in action, take a look on the project!

- Speaking about hooks, this project shares a specific functionality with the [expo-notifications-dashboard](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-dashboard), that is the functionality to fetch data using HTTP protocol. Both projects use exactly the same implementation, take a look: [expo-useFetch](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-app/blob/master/src/hooks/useFetch.ts) and [web-useFetch](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-dashboard/blob/master/src/hooks/useFetch.ts).
This is a perfect example of how we can share code using hooks, we can write the functionality once and reuse them on the web, mobile and wherever you can use React!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run a Expo App, that can be found [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/).

Also, you'll need to the server running locallyon your network. You can find the server and all the instructions to start the server [here](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-api).

### Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-app

$ cd expo-notifications-app
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ yarn
```

_or_

```
$ npm install
```

### Connecting the App with the Server

1 - Follow the instructions on the [expo-notifications-api](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-api) to have the server up and running on your machine.

2 - With the server up and running, go to the [api file](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-app/blob/master/src/api/index.ts#L1)  and reaplace the *< YOUR IP HERE >* for the IP of your machine (you can have some issues with _localhost_ if you're running on an android physical device, but you can use localhost safely on iOS).

It should looks like this:

SERVER_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.25.1:4000/expo-notifications/api/v1';

*or*

SERVER_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:4000/expo-notifications/api/v1';

### Running

With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the app:

Android

```
$ yarn android
```

iOS

```
$ yarn ios
```
